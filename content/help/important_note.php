<h4>Welcome!</h4>
Although these Arduino practice sets require <i>a small amount</i>
of additional knowledge to complete, it is important to know that 
the Arduino exercises are not always directly related to the actual 
course’s psets, quizzes, and lectures (though, I do correlate the grading principles, 
such as scope, style, design, and correctness to them).
<br><br>
One should ensure that one has comprehended the current 
week’s materials to complete the course’s weekly problem set. 
<br><br>
Though, if one is not sure or would like to use lecture-focused practice sets
during section – please contact me at cbartholomew @ fas . harvard . edu or 
let me know at section. I can arrange other practice sets during section instead 
of working with the Arduino.
