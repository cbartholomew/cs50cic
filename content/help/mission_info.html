<h3><a href="#">What are Missions?</a></h3>
<div class="text">
Unlike Practice psets, whereby you interact with simple circuits and problems, Missions 
provide a storyline that the student can progress through by completing each successive mission. 
Each mission will correlate to the Practice pset, slightly. Missions add a little more imagination and fun. 
<br><br>
At the end of every Mission set, there will be an output of numbers in the Arduino's Serial Monitor whereby
the player can then submit the mission's result. Once completed the player will move 
to the next available mission, while progressing through the storyline.

<h3><a href="#">The Story</a></h3>
<div class="text">
The premise of the story is that some US government agency doesn’t have the funding or resources  (what’s new?) 
to place a <i>real spy</i>, full time, on campus to <i>investigate some suspicious rumors</i> that involve potential 
corruption, unwanted propaganda, and events that could lead to the end of the world (pretty scary stuff).
<br><br>
You’re approached by your purposed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_handling">agent handler</a>, Clark Johnson,
who wishes to recruit you as you are familiar with both hardware and software fundamentals (Always remember that a computer 
enthusiast, such as yourself, is a great asset to this world).
<br><br>
Will you help Clark Johnson stop the chaos that could potentially lead to the world's end?
