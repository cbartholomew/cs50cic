<p class="ui-widget-content ui-corner-all info">
The premise of the story is that some US government agency doesn’t have the funding or resources  (what’s new?) to place a <i>real spy</i> full-time on campus to <i>investigate suspicious events</i> that involve corruption, unwanted propaganda, and events, which could end the world (pretty scary stuff).
<br><br>
You’re approached by your purposed <a href=” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_handling”>agent handler</a>, Clark Johnson, who wishes recruit you. Clark knows that you are familiar with both hardware and software fundamentals (Always remember that a computer enthusiast, such as yourself, is a great asset to this world).
<br><br>
Will you help Clark Johnson stop the chaos that could potentially lead to the end of the world?
